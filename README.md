# Atlas Labs HR Dashboard

![Employee Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ef389a6-9a9d-4521-8de4-f7c2750b4501)

Atlas Labs is a fictional software company looking to better understand their workforce. They would like to know general information regarding their employees, where attrition is happening, better understand their employees overall happiness and where they could improve.

This report is broken down into three pages: Employee Overview, Survey Analysis, and Employee Attrition. Employee Overview lists general information such as the number of employees currently employed by their generation or number of employees by their salary range. This page should be used to inform decision makers at Atlas Labs about their workforce and may present areas they could improve. There are two types of surveys on the Survey Analysis page, surveys about how employees feel about their job and enviorment and a performance survey done by the employees and their managers. Employee Attrition shows either attrition count or rate based on the metric you select. Attrition is broken down into similar category's as the Employee Overview.

GPC, or Genuine Parts Company, is one of the largest automotive or industrial aftermarket part distributors in the world. 

By pulling their last four Income Statements off of Yahoo Finance, I assembled a Dashboard with their Income statement, financial ratios, and line charts that display their YoY trends for revenue and EBITDA.
